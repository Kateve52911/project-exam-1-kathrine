I set out to create a webpage using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS whre the content of the website came from a WP REST API that I managed.

## Description

This is a project I created as a student at Noroff as a exam project. I got to choose the theme for the website but it had to use WP REST API and add content dynamically. It is a website that is built and designed to provide an engaging user experience. I wanted to create an inviting blog that gave the user a feeling of being in Ancient Greece while reading about the Greek Gods.

This is to showcase skill in frond-end development. Such as:

- Implemented dynamic content loading to fetch and display posts without needing a full page refresh.
- Used the DOM Manipulation API to create interactive features, such as scripture pop-ups and a submission form.
- Added event listeners for smooth navigation and user interactions, ensuring a seamless experience.
- Applied principles of user-centered design to ensure intuitive navigation and an engaging user experience.
- Integrated dynamic content to provide users with fresh and interesting reading materials.
- Leveraged Netlify for seamless deployment, continuous integration, and hosting, ensuring high performance and reliability.

## Built With
